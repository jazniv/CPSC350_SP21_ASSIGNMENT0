# _Intro:_

# This is a course I have been looking forward to greatly since I declared my major in Computer Science. I've heard many things about the course being challenging and I am looking forward to the challenge. I'm excited to learn more about Trees, Algorithm Analysis, and any theoretical concepts of Computer Science. I honestly don't know what exactly to expect, and am prepared to face it all head-on!
